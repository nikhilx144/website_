                Steps to prepare butter
                <br />
                (a) Unloading: The cans of cream brought to the creamery/
                butter-making factory are unloaded on the receiving platform
                which is at truck-deck height, and arranged according to the
                route and the patrons.
                <br />
                (b) Grading: The purpose of grading is to pay for the product on
                the basis of its quality. Grading and quality payment are the
                efforts made by dairies/creameries to establish a reputation for
                high quality products. Cream is graded on the same principles as
                is milk, i.e., on examinations for smell, taste (seldom carried
                out), appear¬ance, touch, acidity and sediment. The technique
                for grading cream consists in removing the lid of each can of
                cream, inverting it and smelling it. The lid will carry the same
                smell (odour) as the contents of the can. Next, the cream is
                examined for appearance and the presence of any extraneous
                matter. Cream for butter-making is graded in accordance with the
                grades of butter that can be made from it. The cream grades arc:
                First Grade Cream — Sweet or slightly sour Second Grade Cream —
                Sour, coagulated Reject Grade Cream — Markedly sour, fermented.
                <br />
                (c) Sampling: Before sampling, the cream in the can is
                thorough¬ly mixed by a combined rotary and vertical movement of
                the plunger/stirrer. If required, the lidded cans of cream may
                be spray¬ed with hot water to reduce cream viscosity, and
                facilitate mixing. Then a representative sample may be drawn for
                testing purposes.
                <br />
                (d) Weighing: The cans of cream, which have been accepted, are
                then weighed and the weight recorded for accounting and other
                pur¬poses. First-grade creams are tipped directly into the main
                neutra¬lizing vats, while second-grade creams are segregated in
                some factories in a separate vat for separate churning. (The
                cream adhering to the inner walls of the cans is recovered by
                inverting the cans over steaming jets for short periods.)
                <br />
                (e) Testing: The cream samples drawn are then tested for fat,
                solids-not-fat, acidity, etc., by standard methods. Nutritional
                information As butter is essentially just the milk fat, it
                contains only traces of lactose, so moderate consumption of
                butter is not a problem for lactose intolerant people.[59]
                People with milk allergies may still need to avoid butter, which
                contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause
                reactions.[60] Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of
                saturated fat. Health benefits of

                Steps to prepare cream 1 Melt the unsalted butter in a saucepan
                over low-heat. Place ⅓ cup (75 g) of unsalted butter into a
                saucepan. Turn the heat up to low, and wait for the butter to
                melt; you can stir it occasionally with a spoon or rubber
                spatula. 1. 2 Stir 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the melted butter
                into the cold milk. This is known as "tempering" and is very
                important. If you pour all of the melted butter into the milk at
                once, the milk will heat up too fast and curdle.[2] • Whole milk
                will give you the best results, but you can use 2% milk as well.
                • Do this in a separate container; a large measuring cup would
                be ideal. • You are using the entire 3⁄4 cup (180 mL) of cold
                milk for this step. 2. 3 Pour the milk into the rest of the
                butter and cook it over low-heat. Pour the tempered milk into
                the saucepan containing the rest of the butter. Turn the heat up
                to low and wait for the milk to heat up, stirring it often with
                a whisk. Once the milk starts to steam, you are ready for the
                next step.[3] • Do not let the milk come to a boil. 3. 4 Mix the
                cream until it thickens. A blender will work the best, but you
                can use a food processor, an electric mixer, or even a hand-held
                mixer. How long it takes for the cream to thicken depends on
                which tool you use; expect it to take a few minutes, however. •
                You are looking for a thick, creamy consistency--just like heavy
                cream. • This recipe will not thicken into a whipped cream
                consistency. 4. 5 Keep the cream in the fridge and use it within
                1 week. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature first,
                then transfer it into a lidded container and put it into the
                fridge. You can use this as a substitute for most recipes that
                call for heavy cream. Nutritional information Calories 455

                Isoleucine (22.43%) Health benefits of cream 1.Assist growth
                Vitamin B2 is essential for the development and growth of the
                tissues such as eyes, skin, mucous membranes, connective tissue,
                immune system, nervous system and reproductive organs. Moreover,
                it promotes the health of the skin, hair and nails. 2.Form bones
                Phosphorus is essential for the growth of bones as well as
                teeth. It assists calcium for the formation of strong bones. It
                enhances the gum health and tooth enamel. It provides relief
                from the serious ailments such as loss of mineral density or
                bone loss. The studies also shows that it is associated with
                heart health so the adequate intake of phosphorus prevents from
                the cardiovascular ailments. 3.Kidney stones Kidney stones are
                regarded as the crystallized deposits of minerals and calcium in
                the urinary tract. The study shows that high intake of calcium
                lowers the chances of kidney stones. The dietary calcium is not
                the cause for kidney stones but excessive present of minerals in
                water is the cause for kidney stones. The high intake of leafy
                vegetables such as spinach, kale and low intake of fluid might
                result in kidney stones. 4.Reduce stress Pantothenic acid helps
                to reduce the stress and mental problems such as depression,
                anxiety and assist in mind fitness. It helps to regulate the
                hormones which are the cause for these mental conditions.

                Originally, buttermilk was the liquid left behind after churning
                butter out of cream. This type of buttermilk is called
                traditional buttermilk.

                Steps to prepare Buttermilk Step 1 Take a jug, add curd and
                water to it. Use a hand blender or the traditional ‘mathani’ to
                churn it. Keep churning it till you get a smooth consistency.
                Step 2 Add cumin powder, chaat masala and black salt. Again
                blend it few more times till the consistency is reduced. Step 3
                Lastly, garnish with coriander leaves, mint leaves and serve
                chilled. Step 4 You can a pinch of red chilli powder if you like

                Commercially produced buttermilk is comparable to regular milk
                in terms of food energy and fat. One cup (237 mL) of whole milk
                contains 660 kilojoules (157 kilocalories) and 8.9 grams of fat.
                One cup of whole buttermilk contains 640 kJ (152 kcal) and 8.1
                grams of total fat. Low-fat buttermilk is also available.[9]
                Buttermilk contains vitamins, potassium, calcium, and traces of
                phosphorus. Health benefits of Buttermilk 1.Promote healthy
                digestion Buttermilk has probiotic which can help in digestion.
                This bacteria will keep the intestine and the digestion tract
                stay healthy and prevent it from any infection that caused by
                pathogen microorganism such as Helycobacter pilory. This
                bacteria is the common cause of stomach or gut ulcer. 2.Boost
                immune system Not only enhance the digestive system but the
                bacteria in buttermilk improves the digestive system. It
                contains Zinc which strengths the immune cells along with
                Vitamin C. 3.Rehydrate the body Buttermilk is consider as a
                beverage that not only nourish the body but it also contains
                some amount of liquid or water that can help to rehydrate the

                Steps for preparation of cheese Step 1. The first step, when
                making soft cheese, is to slowly heat milk to 86F degrees. This
                can be done on a stovetop with low heat. Quick Tip: The best way
                to make good cheese is to start with good milk. Look for milk
                processed locally, within your state. Milk labelled
                Ultra-Pasteurized will not work for most cheese making recipes.
                ________________________________________ 2. Add Culture Packet
                Step 2. Culture is then added and mixed in before covering the
                pot and letting the milk sit quietly for 6-12 hours. If you are
                not using a pre-measured culture packet rennet may need to be
                added, to coagulate the milk and form a solid curd. What is
                Culture? Culture is a 'friendly bacteria' that converts lactose,
                milk sugar, into lactic acid. Adding specific cultures to milk,
                prevents the growth of unwanted bacteria and helps develop the
                desired flavor and body for your finished cheese.
                ________________________________________ 3. Drain Curds Step 3.
                When ready, the milk will thicken into a solid curd, similar to
                yogurt. The curd can be ladled into a large colander lined with
                Butter Muslin, to drain the whey (liquid). The finished texture
                of your cheese can be customized by draining for more or less
                time. Most curd can be drained at room temperature or in the
                refrigerator. Note: In some recipes, like Creme Fraiche, Sour
                Cream, and Yogurt this step is optional, depending on the
                desired texture. Health benefits of Cheese Home Nutritional
                Facts of Cheese The nutritional composition of cheese depends
                upon the type of cheese. However, we have taken the examples of
                cheddar and mozzarella to mention the base components of cheese.

                make a winning combination for dental health. The calcium and
                other minerals present in cheese help maintain the strength and
                integrity of our teeth well into our old age. 2. Stress
                Reduction Cheese has been observed to reduce panic and anxiety
                attacks. Where this can be attributed to the varieties rich n
                magnesium, a little cheese will certainly help you keep a
                relaxed mind. 3. Probiotic Nature We all know the benefits of
                yogurt as a probiotic, but it is not the only dairy byproduct
                that contains good bacteria. The good bacteria present in cheese
                help maintain gut health. 4. Brain Function For healthy brain
                activity, our body uses the fats it derives from the food we
                eat. Being rich in omega 3 and six fatty acids, cheese is a
                delicious way to keep that mind working.
